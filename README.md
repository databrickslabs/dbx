## Concept

`dbx` simplifies Databricks workflows development, deployment and launch across multiple
environments. It also helps to package your project and deliver it to
your Databricks environment in a versioned fashion. Designed in a
CLI-first manner, it is built to be actively used both inside CI/CD
pipelines and as a part of local tooling for rapid prototyping.

## Requirements

- Python Version \> 3.8
- `pip` or `conda`

## Installation

- with `pip`:

```
pip install dbx
```

## Documentation

Please refer to the [docs page](https://dbx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Interface versioning

For CLI interfaces, we support [SemVer](https://semver.org/) approach.
However, for API components we don't use SemVer as of now. This may lead
to instability when using `dbx` API methods directly.
