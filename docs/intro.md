ðŸ§± Databricks CLI eXtensions - aka `dbx` is a CLI tool for development and advanced Databricks workflows management.

## :octicons-light-bulb-24: Concept

`dbx` aims to improve development experience for Data and ML teams that use Databricks, by providing the following capabilities:

- Ready to use project templates, with built-in support to use custom templates
- Simple configuration for multi-environment setup
- Interactive development loop for Python-based projects
- Flexible deployment configuration
- Built-in versioning for deployments

Since `dbx` primary interface is CLI, it's easy to use it in various CI/CD pipelines, independent of the CI provider.

Read more about the place of `dbx` and potential use-cases in the [ecosystem section](concepts/ecosystem.md).

## :thinking: Differences from other tools

| Tool                                                                                             | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| [databricks-cli](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-cli)                                   | dbx is NOT a replacement for databricks-cli. Quite the opposite - dbx is heavily dependent on databricks-cli and uses most of the APIs exactly from databricks-cli SDK.                                                                                                           |
| [mlflow cli](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html)                                        | dbx is NOT a replacement for mlflow cli. dbx uses some of the MLflow APIs under the hood to store serialized job objects, but doesn't use mlflow CLI directly.                                                                                                                    |
| [Databricks Terraform Provider](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks) | While dbx is primarily oriented on versioned job management, Databricks Terraform Provider provides much wider set of infrastructure settings. In comparison, dbx doesn't provide infrastructure management capabilities, but brings more flexible deployment and launch options. |
| [Databricks Stack CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/stack-cli.html)                 | Databricks Stack CLI is a great component for managing a stack of objects. dbx concentrates on the versioning and packaging jobs together, not treating files and notebooks as a separate component.                                                                              |

## :octicons-stop-24: Limitations

- For interactive development `dbx` can only be used for Python and JVM-based projects.
  Please note that development workflow for JVM-based projects is different from the Python ones.
  For R-based projects, `dbx` can only be used as a deployment management and workflow launch tool.
- `dbx` currently doesn't provide interactive debugging capabilities.
  If you want to use interactive debugging, you can use [Databricks
  Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html), and then use
  `dbx` for deployment operations.
- [Delta Live
  Tables](https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) are supported for deployment and launch. The interactive execution mode is not supported. Please read more on DLT with `dbx` in [this guide](guides/general/delta_live_tables.md).
