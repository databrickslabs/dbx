    Sync local files to Databricks and watch for changes, with support for syncing to a path
    in [DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/data/databricks-file-system.html), a
    [Databricks Repo](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html), or an arbitrary 
    [Databricks Workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-assets.html#files) location 
    via the `dbfs`, `repo`, and `workspace` subcommands, respectively.


    This enables one to incrementally sync local files to Databricks in order to enable quick, iterative
    development in an IDE with the ability to test changes almost immediately in Databricks notebooks.


    Suppose you are using the [Repos for Git integration](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html) feature
    and have cloned a git repo within Databricks where you have Python notebooks stored as well as various Python
    modules that the notebooks import.


    You can edit any of these files directly in Databricks.
    The `dbx sync repo` command provides an additional option: edit the files in a local repo on your computer
    in an IDE of your choice and sync the changes to the repo in Databricks as you make changes.


    For example, when run from a local git clone, the following will sync all the files to an existing repo
    named `myrepo` in Databricks and watch for changes:

    ```
    dbx sync repo -d myrepo
    ```

    At the top of your notebook you can turn on
    [autoreload](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/config/extensions/autoreload.html) so that execution of cells
    will automatically pick up the changes:

    ```
    %load_ext autoreload
    %autoreload 2
    ```

    The `dbx sync repo` command syncs to a repo in Databricks. If that repo is a git clone you can see the
    changes made to the files, as if you'd made the edits directly in Databricks.


    Similarly, the `dbx sync workspace` command also allows you to edit the files in a local repo on your computer
    in an IDE of your choice and sync the changes to Databricks. Repos are recommended when available, but this provides
    flexibility for organizations in which Repos may not yet be enabled.


    As above, the following will sync all the files to a new or existing workspace location. Note that passing a 
    relative path will result in these files being synced to your user-level directory (i.e., /Users/<user>/<dest>), 
    whereas passing an absolute path will sync files to the location specified. If parent directories do not exist,
    they will automatically be created.

    ```
    dbx sync workspace -d myrepo
    ```

    When using Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, support for 
    [relative imports and programmatic reads/writes](https://docs.databricks.com/files/workspace.html) 
    should be synonymous with that found in Databricks Repos.


    Alternatively, you can use `dbx sync dbfs` to sync the files to a path in DBFS.
    This keeps the files independent from the repos but still allows you to use them in notebooks
    either in a repo or in notebooks existing in your workspace.


    For example, when run from a local git clone in a `myrepo` directory under a user
    `first.last@somewhere.com`, the following will sync all the files to the DBFS path
    `/tmp/users/first.last/myrepo`:

    ```
    dbx sync dbfs
    ```

    The destination path can also be specified, as in: `-d /tmp/myrepo`.

    When executing notebooks in a repo, the root of the repo is automatically added to the Python path so that
    imports work relative to the repo root. This means that aside from turning on autoreload you don't need to do
    anything else special for the changes to be reflected in the cell's execution.

    However, when syncing to DBFS, for the imports to work you need to update the Python path to include
    this target directory you're syncing to.


    For example, to import from the `/tmp/users/first.last/myrepo` path used above, use the following at the top
    of your notebook:

    ```python
    import sys

    if "/dbfs/tmp/users/first.last/myrepo" not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, "/dbfs/tmp/users/first.last/myrepo")
    ```

    The `dbx sync` commands have many options for controlling which files/directories to include/exclude from
    syncing, which are well documented below.  For convenience, all patterns listed in a `.gitignore` at the
    source will be excluded from syncing. The `.git` directory is excluded as well.""",
