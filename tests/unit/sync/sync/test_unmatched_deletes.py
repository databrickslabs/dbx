    """
    Tests that RemoteSyncer can properly handle unmatched deletes.

    Unmatched deletes occur when the filter options (e.g. includes) change in such a way that files/directories
    that were synced in a previous run are no longer matched.  Because the sync state keeps track of what has
    been synced, this would result in the files being deleted in the destination.  This may or may not be what the
    user wants to happen, so we give them the option to decide what to do.

    If they don't specify an option, then we use click.confirm to ask whether they want to delete or not.
    The alternative is to provide the option on the command line, which becomes the delete_unmatched_option param.
